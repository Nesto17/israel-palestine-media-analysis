## Media Coverage on Israel-Palestine Conflict

---

Possible areas that we're going to explore (subject to change):

- shift of sentiment over time regarding key terms/hashtags 
- network analysis of misinformation spread
- spread of unverified content + fact checked claim over social media
- types of misinformation over different periods
- how different media frames different events related to the conflict 
- efficacy of fact-checking â€” how quickly is misinformation debunked and how widely are corrections being shared
