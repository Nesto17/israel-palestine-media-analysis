# Introduction

This project seeks to uncover how media narratives surrounding the Israel-Palestine conflict shape public perception and expose the dangers of misinformation. By analyzing textual data from Reddit, alongside a timeline of conflicts and fatalities, we aim to explore how information is framed, disseminated, and amplified. The focus will be on identifying patterns of misinformation, sensationalism, and bias that distort public understanding of key events.

Our analysis will delve into how specific narratives gain traction, the role of influential accounts in propagating unverified claims, and the distinct ways different platforms approach discussions on the conflict. A key aspect of this study involves examining the temporal relationship between real-world events and media coverage, assessing how misinformation emerges during moments of heightened tension or significant fatalities.

Through sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and engagement metrics, we will explore how emotionally charged or misleading content influences online discourse. By doing so, we aim to highlight the critical need for accountability in media reporting and the risks posed by unchecked misinformation, including its potential to exacerbate conflicts, deepen societal polarization, and hinder informed decision-making.

This framework outlines our approach to the project and serves as our starting point. While the ideas presented here provide a foundational guide, they may evolve as new insights emerge during the course of our analysis.
