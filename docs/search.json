    "text": "1 Introduction\nThis project examines how Reddit users engaged with the Israel-Hamas conflict during its escalation in October 2023. We chose this topic because of our interest in data journalism and the growing role of social media platforms like Reddit in shaping public discourse, particularly among younger audiences. While platforms like Facebook and Instagram remain popular, Reddit has become a hub for diverse conversations, making it a valuable resource for analyzing how people discuss and respond to real-world events.\nWe’re also interested in using data visualization to better understand modern conflicts. Social media plays a significant role in influencing political discourse and shaping geopolitics, and this project focuses on Reddit as a case study to explore its role in framing narratives around the Israel-Hamas conflict. The conflict, which escalated after a surprise attack by Hamas on October 7, 2023, has received substantial media attention, sparking global debates and emotional responses. We wanted to go beyond surface-level observations and examine the data behind this discourse, uncovering any unique trends or insights.\nTo achieve this, we explored the following topics during the project: 1. Daily Trends in Submissions and Engagement: Analyzing how the volume of submissions and unique user activity fluctuated over time, especially around key events in the conflict. 2. Submissions by Subreddit: Comparing how different subreddits—such as Israel, Palestine, and worldnews—engaged with the conflict. 3. User Activity and Upvotes: Investigating correlations between user activity and total upvotes to identify patterns of engagement. 4. Controversiality of Discussions: Examining whether controversial topics generated more comments or upvotes, and how they compared to non-controversial posts. 5. Conversation Topics: Categorizing discussions into themes like “FreePalestine&Islamophobia,” “Zionism&Antisemitism,” and “Non-Related” to understand the focus of conversations. 6. Distribution of Comments and Upvotes: Exploring the distribution of comments and upvotes across posts to measure engagement levels. 7. Impact of Conflict Events on Activity: Mapping submission volumes and engagement spikes against major events in the conflict, such as the Hamas attack and temporary ceasefires.\nThrough these analyses, we aimed to make sense of how Reddit users engaged with the Israel-Hamas conflict and uncover the ways social media influences modern political and geopolitical discourse.",

    "text": "2.1 Description\nFor this project, we used the IsamasRed dataset, a publicly available dataset that tracks Reddit discussions on the Israel-Hamas conflict from August 2023 to November 2023. This dataset was compiled by researchers Kai Chen, Zihao He, Keith Burghardt, Jingxin Zhang, and Kristina Lerman. It includes nearly 400,000 conversations and over 8 million comments across Reddit, capturing the public discourse surrounding this event.\nThe data collection process used a keyword extraction framework powered by GPT-4 to ensure coverage of relevant discussions. The dataset provides detailed attributes for submissions, comments, and conversations, such as subreddit names, authors, timestamps, scores, upvotes, controversy markers, and thematic labels like “FreePalestine&Islamophobia” or “Zionism&Antisemitism.” This structure enabled us to analyze the relationship between discussion topics, engagement patterns, and user behaviors.\nThe data is stored in JSON format and was last updated in January 2024. Due to its large size, we contacted the authors directly to access the full dataset, as it was too big to host on our own repository. We encountered file size issues, particularly with the comments.csv file, which we addressed by resampling the data to 500,000 rows for comments and 50,000 rows for conversations. This resampling retained the time-based proportions, ensuring that trend lines remained accurate for analysis.\nThe dataset can be accessed via",

    "section": "2.2 Missing Value Analysis",
    "text": "2.2 Missing Value Analysis\nWe analyzed the IsamasRed dataset to identify missing values across submissions and comments. We wanted to check on the accuracy and completeness of the dataset, which would affect our findings.\n\n\nCode\n# missing_values_submissions &lt;- submissions %&gt;%\n#   mutate(timestamp = as_datetime(timestamp)) %&gt;%  \n#   select(subreddit, id, author, timestamp, title, text, score, upvote_ratio, upvotes) %&gt;%  # Ensure only required attributes are selected\n#   summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %&gt;%\n#   pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"attribute\", values_to = \"missing_count\")\n# \n# ggplot(missing_values_submissions, aes(x = reorder(attribute, missing_count), y = missing_count)) +\n#   geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n#   coord_flip() +\n#   scale_y_continuous(\n#     breaks = seq(0, max(missing_values_submissions$missing_count, na.rm = TRUE), by = 50000),\n#     labels = scales::comma\n#   ) +\n#   labs(\n#     title = \"Missing Values in Submissions Data\",\n#     x = \"Attributes\",\n#     y = \"Count of Missing Values\"\n#   ) +\n#   theme_minimal() +\n#   theme(\n#     axis.text.x = element_text(size = 10),\n#     axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n#     plot.title = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n#     axis.title = element_text(size = 12)\n#   )\n\n\nThe text field has the highest count of missing values, surpassing 250,000. This is expected since many submissions on Reddit consist only of a title without any additional text in the body. The absence of text in a large number of submissions does not hinder the analysis significantly, as the title typically captures the key content of Reddit posts. All other attributes—such as upvotes, upvote_ratio, title, timestamp, subreddit, score, id, and author—have no missing values. This suggests that the dataset is complete for these attributes, which will ensure that our analysis for future engagement metrics and temporal trends are accurate.\n\n\nCode\n# missing_values_comments &lt;- comments %&gt;%\n#   summarise(across(everything(), ~ sum(is.na(.)))) %&gt;%\n#   pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = \"attribute\", values_to = \"missing_count\")\n# \n# ggplot(missing_values_comments, aes(x = reorder(attribute, missing_count), y = missing_count)) +\n#   geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"seagreen\") +\n#   coord_flip() +\n#   labs(\n#     title = \"Missing Values in Comments Data\",\n#     x = \"Attributes\",\n#     y = \"Count of Missing Values\"\n#   ) +\n#   theme_minimal()\n\n\nThe text field in the comments data has the highest number of missing values, approximately 1,500. This is expected, as some comments might not have meaningful text content (e.g., deleted or removed comments by moderators or users). This is a common occurrence on Reddit and does not significantly impact overall analysis.\nAll other attributes, such as ups, timestamp, subreddit, submission_id, score, parent_id, id, downs, controversial, and author, show no missing values.",

    "text": "3.2 Analyses and Visualizations\n\n3.2.1 Volume of Submissions over Time\nThis line chart represents the daily volume of submissions over time on Reddit, showcasing the fluctuations in user engagement within the context of discussions about the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n\nCode\nsubmissions &lt;- submissions %&gt;%\n  mutate(timestamp = as_datetime(timestamp)) \n\nsubmissions_daily &lt;- submissions %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as_date(timestamp)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    daily_submissions = n(),             \n    unique_authors = n_distinct(author)     \n  )\n\nggplot(submissions_daily, aes(x = date, y = daily_submissions)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue3\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Volume of Submissions Over Time\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Submissions\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)  \n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom August to early October, submission volumes were relatively stable, fluctuating between 2,000 to 3,000 daily posts. This period likely represents routine discussions and ongoing global interest in Middle Eastern affairs without a significant catalyst driving heightened engagement.\nA sharp and sudden increase in submissions is observed starting October 7, 2023, with volumes exceeding 7,500 posts per day.This surge timeline aligns with the Hamas surprise attack on Israel, which marks a significant escalation in the Israel-Hamas conflict. The attack resulted in widespread casualties, kidnappings, and retaliatory airstrikes by Israel, capturing global attention. The elevated submissions reflect heightened discourse, including breaking news updates, debates, emotional responses, and solidarity messages.\nAfter the initial spike, submission volumes remained high, though they showed a gradual decline over the subsequent weeks. This sustained activity corresponds with continued media coverage of the conflict, escalating violence in Gaza, and international diplomatic efforts to mediate the crisis. The smaller fluctuations during this period might represent specific events or developments, such as ceasefire negotiations or notable incidents reported in the news.\nSubmission volumes began to taper off toward the end of November and into December, stabilizing at around 3,000–4,000 daily posts. This decline could signify reduced immediate interest as the conflict entered a prolonged phase without significant new developments or a shift in media focus to other global issues.\n\n\n3.2.2 Relationship between Submissions and Unique Users\nWe wanted to explore the dynamics of submissions and unique user activity over time, to provide a deeper understanding of how Reddit users engaged with the Israel-Hamas conflict during the post-conflict, analysis period.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(submissions_daily) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = daily_submissions, color = \"Submissions\"), size = 1) +\n  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = unique_authors, color = \"Unique Users\"), size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Volume of Submissions and Unique Users Over Time\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Count\",\n    color = \"Legend\"  \n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Submissions\" = \"blue3\", \"Unique Users\" = \"cornflowerblue\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)  \n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, both submissions (dark blue) and unique users (light blue) show a dramatic rise starting October 7, 2023, corresponding to the Hamas surprise attack on Israel. The increase in unique users suggests the event attracted a broader audience, including those who might not typically engage with Israel-Palestine discussions.\nSubmission activity remained elevated through October, even as unique user counts started to stabilize. This suggests that while overall participation plateaued, a subset of highly engaged users continued driving discussions.\nBoth metrics begin to decline post-November, reflecting reduced activity as public interest waned, likely due to the normalization of the conflict or shifts in media coverage. The difference in the slopes of the two lines indicates that while fewer unique users contributed to the conversation, those who remained were responsible for a substantial number of posts.\nOverall, both submissions (red) and unique users (blue) show a dramatic rise starting October 7, 2023, corresponding to the Hamas surprise attack on Israel.

The difference in the slopes of the two lines indicates that while fewer unique users contributed to the conversation, those who remained were responsible for a substantial number of posts.\n\n\n3.2.3 Ratio of Unique Users to Submission\nNext, we examine the ratio of unique users to submissions over time, to investigate whether Reddit activity was driven by a few highly active individuals or a broader user base.\n\n\nCode\nsubmissions_daily &lt;- submissions_daily %&gt;%\n  mutate(users_to_submissions_ratio = unique_authors / daily_submissions)\n\nggplot(submissions_daily, aes(x = date, y = users_to_submissions_ratio)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue3\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Ratio of Unique Users to Submissions Over Time\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Unique Users / Submissions\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom August to early October, the ratio remains relatively stable, fluctuating between 0.4 and 0.6. This indicates that on average, there were 2–3 submissions per user, suggesting a balanced engagement among the user base.\nOn October 7, 2023, the ratio plummets sharply, reaching a low of around 0.3. This sudden drop aligns with the Hamas attack on Israel, suggesting that while the number of submissions surged (as seen in previous graphs), a significant portion of this activity came from a few highly active users repeatedly posting updates, opinions, or reactions.\nAfter the initial spike, the ratio remains below the pre-October baseline, hovering around 0.35–0.4. This indicates that even as submission volumes decreased slightly, the conversation was still dominated by a smaller, highly engaged subset of users, reflecting the ongoing intensity of the conflict discussions.\nThe ratio starts to recover toward 0.4–0.45 in November and December, suggesting that the broader user base re-engaged, albeit with fewer submissions overall.\n\n\n3.2.4 Popularity of Submissions Over Time\nBeyond initial user attraction, we wanted to investigate the total upvotes on submissions over time, to visualize the aggregated number of upvotes received by Reddit submissions each day. This will offer us insights into how user engagement trends evolved during the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n\nCode\nsubmissions_daily &lt;- submissions %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as_date(timestamp)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(daily_upvotes = sum(upvotes, na.rm = TRUE))\n\nggplot(submissions_daily, aes(x = date, y = daily_upvotes)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"chartreuse3\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Total Upvotes on Submissions Over Time\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Upvotes\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom August to early October, daily upvotes remain relatively constant and low, rarely exceeding 100,000 upvotes per day. This period reflects routine activity on Reddit, where submissions attracted a consistent but modest level of engagement.\nA significant increase in upvotes begins on October 7, 2023, coinciding with the Hamas attack on Israel. Daily upvotes spike dramatically, surpassing 400,000 upvotes per day, suggesting widespread user interaction with highly upvoted posts. This likely reflects breaking news, updates, solidarity messages, and emotionally charged content resonating with the community.\nUpvotes remain elevated throughout October and into November, albeit with some fluctuations. Upvotes remain elevated throughout October and into November, albeit with some fluctuations.\nEngagement begins to taper off in December, with daily upvotes declining back to 100,000–200,000 upvotes per day. This mirrors a reduction in submission volumes, as public attention shifted or normalized around the ongoing conflict.\n\n\n3.2.5 Total Quantity of Daily Submissions\nNext, we wanted to investigate if there were variations in the total quantity of daily submissions across selected subreddits. This is represented in the graph below by Israel (red), Palestine (green), and worldnews (blue). This will provide insights into how different communities engaged with the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n\nCode\nsubreddit_comparison &lt;- submissions %&gt;%\n  filter(subreddit %in% c(\"Israel\", \"Palestine\", \"worldnews\")) %&gt;%  \n  mutate(date = as_date(timestamp)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(subreddit, date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(daily_submissions = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\nggplot(subreddit_comparison, aes(x = date, y = daily_submissions, color = subreddit)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Daily Submissions Across Selected Subreddits\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Submissions\",\n    color = \"Subreddit\"\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    values = c(\"Israel\" = \"brown2\", \"Palestine\" = \"chartreuse3\", \"worldnews\" = \"gray3\")\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three subreddits maintain a relatively stable level of activity from August to early October, with worldnews consistently having higher submission volumes compared to the conflict-focused subreddits (Israel and Palestine). This reflects general interest in global events and regional discussions before the conflict escalation.\nA sharp surge in activity occurs across all subreddits on October 7, 2023, coinciding with the Hamas attack on Israel. worldnews experiences the highest spike, with over 400 daily submissions, indicating its role as a hub for global news discussions. Both Israel and Palestine subreddits also show significant increases, though on a smaller scale, reflecting their more focused communities.\nAfter the initial surge, worldnews maintains elevated activity levels, albeit with gradual fluctuations, as users continue discussing broader global perspectives and updates. Palestine sees sustained high submission levels, possibly due to continued reports on humanitarian crises and international responses. Israel experiences a sharp decline in daily submissions post-November, likely reflecting a drop in specific discussions or the community’s transition to other forms of engagement.\nAll subreddits exhibit gradual declines in activity, though worldnews and Palestine retain relatively higher engagement compared to Israel.\n\n\n3.2.6 Relationship between Key Conflict Events and Submission Volume\nWe were curious if we could map out the submission volume against key conflict events, and hence we plotted the daily submission volumes on Reddit alongside annotations for significant events in the Israel-Hamas conflict during October–November 2023. We found it extremely interesting that the inclusion of key events highlights the direct correlation between real-world events and online activity.\n\n\nCode\nsubmissions_daily &lt;- submissions %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as_date(timestamp)) %&gt;% \n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    daily_submissions = n() \n  )\nkey_events &lt;- data.frame(\n  date = as.Date(c(\"2023-10-07\", \"2023-11-22\", \"2023-11-30\")),\n  event = c(\"Hamas Attack\", \"Temporary Truce\", \"Truce Extended\")\n)\n\nggplot(submissions_daily, aes(x = date, y = daily_submissions)) +\n  geom_line(color = \"blue3\", size = 1) +\n  geom_vline(data = key_events, aes(xintercept = as.numeric(date)), color = \"deepskyblue2\", linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  geom_text(data = key_events, aes(x = date, y = max(submissions_daily$daily_submissions), label = event),\n            angle = 90, vjust = -0.5, hjust = 1, size = 3, color = \"deepskyblue2\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Submission Volume with Key Conflict Events\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Number of Submissions\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Hamas Attack on Israel led to a sudden and dramatic increase in daily submissions, surpassing 7,500 posts on October 7, 2023. After October 7, submission volumes began to decline but remained elevated through October and early November.\nThe Temporary Truce on November 22, 2023, marked a brief resurgence in submission volumes, reflecting heightened discussions around the ceasefire, its terms, and its implications for the conflict. The spike suggests that Reddit users were actively tracking and reacting to developments during this period.\nFollowing the Truce Extended event on November 30, submission volumes continued to decrease, returning to pre-October levels by early December. This reflects a normalization of engagement as the immediacy of the crisis faded and public attention shifted.\n\n\n3.2.7 Correlation between Upvotes and Unique Users\nWe wanted to visualise the correlation betwen upvotes and unique users; to visualise the relationship between the number of unique users contributing to submissions and the total upvotes those submissions received each day. The addition of a linear regression line (red dashed line) highlights the overall trend in the data.\n\n\nCode\nsubmissions_daily &lt;- submissions %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as_date(timestamp)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date) %&gt;%\n  summarise(\n    daily_upvotes = sum(upvotes, na.rm = TRUE),\n    unique_users = n_distinct(author)\n  )\n\nggplot(submissions_daily, aes(x = unique_users, y = daily_upvotes)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"blue3\", size = 2) +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"deepskyblue3\", linetype = \"dashed\", size = 1) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Correlation Between Upvotes and Unique Users\",\n    x = \"Unique Users\",\n    y = \"Total Upvotes\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe upward slope of the regression line indicates a positive correlation between unique user participation and total upvotes. This suggests that as more users engage with submissions, the likelihood of higher upvote counts increases.\nA cluster of points with extremely high upvotes (above 200,000) is visible even at relatively moderate levels of unique user participation (1,000–2,000 users). This may indicate that certain highly upvoted submissions (e.g., breaking news or viral content) resonate widely, even with a smaller active user base.\nAt the far right of the chart, days with the highest unique user counts (above 3,000 users) do not consistently correspond to the highest upvote totals. This suggests that user participation and content validation are not always perfectly aligned.\n\n\n3.2.8 Distribution of Comment Counts per Submission\nWe also wanted to look at the distribution of comment counts per submission, which will provide insights into the engagement levels and discussion dynamics on Reddit during the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\n\nCode\ncomment_counts &lt;- comments %&gt;%\n  group_by(submission_id) %&gt;%\n  summarise(comment_count = n())\n\nsubmissions_with_comments &lt;- submissions %&gt;%\n  left_join(comment_counts, by = c(\"id\" = \"submission_id\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(comment_count = ifelse(is.na(comment_count), 0, comment_count))\n\nggplot(submissions_with_comments, aes(x = comment_count)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = \"darkslateblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 50), breaks = seq(0, 50, by = 5)) +  \n  scale_y_log10() +  \n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Comment Counts per Submission\",\n    x = \"Number of Comments\",\n    y = \"Frequency (Log Scale)\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of submissions receive fewer than 5 comments, as evidenced by the sharp drop in frequency for higher comment counts. This indicates that most posts generate limited discussion, reflecting either lower visibility or less engaging content.\nA small but significant portion of submissions receives 30 or more comments, suggesting highly engaging or polarizing content that sparks extended discussions. This long tail reflects the disproportionate impact of certain posts in driving conversations.\nWe used a logarithmic scale on the y-axis to highlight the exponential drop in frequency as comment counts increase. Without this transformation, the disparity between low-comment and high-comment submissions would be even more pronounced.\n\n\n3.2.9 Finding Largest Subreddits by Submissions and Comments Count\nWe wanted to find out what were the largest subreddits by number of submissions and comments\nTop 20 largest subreddits by number of submissions\n\n\nCode\nsubreddit_counts &lt;- submissions %&gt;%\n  group_by(subreddit) %&gt;%\n  summarise(frequency = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(frequency)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 20)\n\nggplot(subreddit_counts, aes(x = reorder(subreddit, frequency), y = frequency)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"cornflowerblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 20 Subreddits by Number of Submissions\",\n    x = \"Subreddit\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAutoNewspaper ranks first, with over 30,000 submissions. This automated subreddit likely reposts news headlines, contributing to its high volume of activity but potentially limited engagement. Subreddits like Palestine, IsraelPalestine, and IsraelHamasWar feature prominently, reflecting their focus on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Their inclusion highlights how niche communities actively discuss the conflict through posts. Broader subreddits like worldnews, AskMiddleEast, and news also rank high, illustrating their role as platforms for regional and global discourse.\nTop 20 subreddits by comments\n\n\nCode\nsubreddit_comment_counts &lt;- comments %&gt;%\n  group_by(subreddit) %&gt;%\n  summarise(frequency = n()) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(frequency)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 20) \n\nggplot(subreddit_comment_counts, aes(x = reorder(subreddit, frequency), y = frequency)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"lightseagreen\", color = \"white\") +\n  coord_flip() + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Top 20 Subreddits by Number of Comments\",\n    x = \"Subreddit\",\n    y = \"Frequency\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nworldnews dominates with the highest number of comments, exceeding 100,000. This underscores its role as a hub for engaging discussions on global issues, including the conflict. IsraelPalestine ranks second, followed by AskMiddleEast and Palestine, indicating that these communities not only attract submissions but also foster extensive conversations. Subreddits like CombatFootage, PublicFreakout, and Destiny also appear, suggesting that conflict-related content resonates in broader and sometimes unrelated communities.\n\n\n3.2.10 Volume of Submissions of each Conversation Topic\nA conversation is a combined entity of a submission and multiple comments related to it. The creator of the dataset generated every conversation through existing submissions and comments datasets. With added features such as freepalestine_islamophobia and zionism_antisemitism, we can dive deeper into how these factors could affect the magnitude and proportion of other features. We could also understand further how certain subreddits are more skewed and biased towards one topic over the other, and many other analyses that we can conduct.\nFor better clarity, the topic of each conversation will be labeled as either:\n\nFreePalestine&Islamophobia: relating to Free Palestine / Islamophobia\nZionism&Antisemitism: relating to Zionism / Antisemitism\nNon-Related: relating to neither\nTwo-Sided: the conversation has been labeled as containing both topics\n\n\n\nCode\ntemporal_data &lt;- conversations %&gt;%\n  mutate(subset = case_when(\n    freepalestine_islamophobia == 1 & zionism_antisemitism == 0 ~ \"FreePalestine&Islamophobia\",\n    freepalestine_islamophobia == 0 & zionism_antisemitism == 1 ~ \"Zionism&Antisemitism\",\n    freepalestine_islamophobia == 0 & zionism_antisemitism == 0 ~ \"Non-Related\",\n    freepalestine_islamophobia == 1 & zionism_antisemitism == 1 ~ \"Two-Sided\"\n  )) %&gt;%\n  mutate(date = as.Date(datetime)) %&gt;%\n  group_by(date, subset) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\nggplot(temporal_data, aes(x = date, y = count, color = subset)) +\n  geom_line(size = 1) +\n  labs(title = \"Volume of Submissions of Conversation Topics\",\n       x = \"Date\",\n       y = \"Number of Conversations\",\n       color = \"Topic\") +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\n    \"FreePalestine&Islamophobia\" = \"chartreuse2\",\n    \"Zionism&Antisemitism\" = \"brown2\",\n    \"Non-Related\" = \"cornflowerblue\",\n    \"Two-Sided\" = \"gray3\"\n  )) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe spike in “Non-Related” conversations during the Israel-Hamas war, instead of related topics like Zionism or Islamophobia, may stem from:\n\nGeneral news coverage often frames events in geopolitical or humanitarian terms, attracting a wider audience.\nGeneral-purpose subreddits like “news” or “worldnews” aggregate discussions, while specific subreddits may have stricter moderation.\nCasual users may prefer less polarizing spaces for discussion, avoiding ideological debates.\nConversations touching on related themes might still be categorized as “Non-Related” due to ambiguous language.\nDiscussions may center on civilian casualties or global reactions, which don’t align with ideological categories.\n\n\n\n3.2.11 Distribution of Popularity of each Conversation Topic\n\n\nCode\ncategorized_conversations &lt;- conversations %&gt;%\n  mutate(subset = case_when(\n    freepalestine_islamophobia == 1 & zionism_antisemitism == 0 ~ \"FreePalestine&Islamophobia\",\n    freepalestine_islamophobia == 0 & zionism_antisemitism == 1 ~ \"Zionism&Antisemitism\",\n    freepalestine_islamophobia == 0 & zionism_antisemitism == 0 ~ \"Non-Related\",\n    freepalestine_islamophobia == 1 & zionism_antisemitism == 1 ~ \"Two-Sided\"\n  ))\n\nggplot(categorized_conversations, aes(x = subset, y = log(upvotes), fill = subset)) +\n  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = 0.7) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = 0.2, outlier.shape = NA, alpha = 0.5) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Popularity by Conversation Topic\",\n    x = \"Conversation Topic\",\n    y = \"Log(Upvotes)\",\n    fill = \"Topic\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"FreePalestine&Islamophobia\" = \"chartreuse2\",\n    \"Zionism&Antisemitism\" = \"brown2\",\n    \"Non-Related\" = \"darkslategray4\",\n    \"Two-Sided\" = \"gray3\"\n  )) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),\n    legend.position = \"none\" # Remove legend if redundant\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe violin plot shows the distribution of log-transformed upvotes for each conversation topic.

This broader perspective provides context on overall engagement but dilutes the focus on politically relevant conversations.\nThe second visualization focuses on conflict-related topics (FreePalestine&Islamophobia, Two-Sided, Zionism&Antisemitism), highlighting their distribution across subreddits. It offers a more focused view relevant to the political climate, emphasizing the volume of conversations directly tied to the conflict.\n\n\n3.2.13 Relationship between Conversation Topics and Controversiality\n\n\nCode\njoined_data &lt;- comments %&gt;%\n  inner_join(conversations, by = c(\"submission_id\" = \"id\")) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    subset = case_when(\n      freepalestine_islamophobia == 1 & zionism_antisemitism == 0 ~ \"FreePalestine&Islamophobia\",\n      freepalestine_islamophobia == 0 & zionism_antisemitism == 1 ~ \"Zionism&Antisemitism\",\n      freepalestine_islamophobia == 0 & zionism_antisemitism == 0 ~ \"Non-Related\",\n      freepalestine_islamophobia == 1 & zionism_antisemitism == 1 ~ \"Two-Sided\"\n    )\n  )\n\nmosaic_data &lt;- joined_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(subset, controversial) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\nggplot(mosaic_data, aes(x = subset, y = as.factor(controversial), fill = count)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Mosaic Plot of Conversation Topics vs. Controversial Comments\",\n    x = \"Conversation Topic\",\n    y = \"Controversial (0 = No, 1 = Yes)\",\n    fill = \"Count\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"azure2\", high = \"blue3\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mosaic plot shows that “Non-Related” topics dominate conversations, with most comments being non-controversial. Controversial comments are sparse across all topics, and related topics like “Zionism&Antisemitism” and “Two-Sided” have significantly fewer conversations overall. “Controversial” comments (1) are sparse across all conversation topics, suggesting limited polarizing discussions.",

    "text": "This project offered a look into how Reddit users discussed and engaged with the Israel-Hamas conflict during its escalation in October 2023. By examining submission volumes, user activity, and conversation dynamics, we uncovered key trends that align with major real-world events. The sustained high levels of activity in subsequent weeks reflected ongoing interest in the conflict, with patterns suggesting that a small but active subset of users drove much of the engagement. Additionally, our analysis of subreddit dynamics revealed how communities with different focuses contributed uniquely to the discussion.\nDespite its strengths, the project had several limitations. The dataset included missing values for text fields in submissions and comments, likely due to deleted or removed content, which constrained certain types of analysis, such as sentiment or text-based topic modeling. Moreover, resampling the data to handle size limitations, while preserving trends, reduced the granularity of analysis in some areas. Another limitation was the inherent bias in subreddit activity, as discussions in smaller, niche communities may not reflect broader public opinion.\nLooking ahead, future work could address these limitations by exploring other platforms like Twitter or Instagram to compare engagement trends across different demographics. Expanding the timeframe to capture post-conflict developments or including additional attributes, such as user geolocation or language, could provide deeper insights into the global reach and influence of such discussions.\nThis project reinforced several lessons. First, real-world events have a profound and immediate impact on online activity, offering a unique window into public sentiment and engagement. Second, working with large datasets requires robust preprocessing techniques and thoughtful resampling strategies to balance performance and accuracy. Finally, visualising data allowed us to simplify complex trends and make data accessible, enabling a clearer understanding of how social media platforms like Reddit influence modern political and geopolitical discourse.",
