An interactive temporal chart of comments volume per subreddit helps analyze your project by:

- Identifying Trends: Visualizing spikes and dips in comment activity over time highlights key events and changes in interest.
- Correlating with Events: Aligning comment trends with external events reveals how Reddit responds to real-world happenings. 
- Subreddit Behavior: Comparing subreddits uncovers which are most active, act as "early responders," or sustain long-term engagement.
- Dynamic Exploration: Interactivity allows filtering by time or subreddit, focusing on specific periods or communities for deeper insights.
- Testing Hypotheses: Validates assumptions, such as which subreddits lead discussions or whether engagement aligns with media trends.

This chart transforms raw data into actionable insights by showing how discussions evolve and differ across subreddits.
